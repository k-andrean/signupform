# signupform
The odin project sign up form


Created signup form for getting user information using simple label, input and utilizing css elements like positioning, flexbox etc to style the form so that it resembled form used for website to get user to sign up before login. Used value like vw, vh, em and rem to style the margin, width, font-size etc so that when the form is rescaled the elements inside are also positioned responsively.

Added some javascript element to check and compare user inputted password value with confirm password input value before submitting to make sure these two value matched each other.
